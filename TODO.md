# TODO List

Each todo should be marked with an estimated complexity estimate.
Each target (e.g. `mips`, has a separate `TODO.md`).

## General Components

- `zs_extend`, extension with input to select either zero or sign extension. (Complexity low.)
  
## Vizia Widgets/helpers

- Better tooltips for components. (Complexity moderate.)

- Better popups for components. (Complexity moderate.)

## Egui

- Add better formatted tooltip for probe, maybe use ``LayoutJob``, if style is not respected maybe force to ``galley`` (Complexity low, but weird egui stuff)
